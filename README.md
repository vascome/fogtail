Demo Android applications built to highlight MVP/MVVM and Clean Architecture (VIPER) concepts using Java/Kotlin

It's based on some known projects like [qualitymatters](https://github.com/artem-zinnatullin/qualitymatters), [u2020](https://github.com/JakeWharton/u2020),
[google architecture samples](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture), etc

##### Structure
* `MVPJava` - mvp demo project which showcases usage of Dagger2 among other open source libraries. (no RX here)
* `MVPJavaRX`   - mvp demo project which showcases usage of Dagger2, RxJava 2, etc
* `MVPJavaRXDagger2`   - mvp demo project Dagger2 + DaggerAndroid, RxJava 2, etc
* `CleanJava` - clean architeure demo project based on MVP with Dagger, without Rx.
* `CleanJavaRX` - clean architeure demo project based on MVP with Dagger2+DaggerAndroid, RxJava.
* `CleanKotlin` - clean architeure demo project based on MVP. with RxJava
